# CD Golf League Testing Strategy

This document outlines our comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the CD Golf League application remains stable and reliable across all environments.

## Testing Layers

Our testing approach consists of three main layers:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components and services
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete user flows and scenarios

## Test Types

### API Tests

API tests verify that our backend services function correctly.

- **Endpoints**: Test all API endpoints for correct responses
- **Error Handling**: Verify proper error responses
- **Authentication**: Test protected routes
- **Database Interactions**: Test CRUD operations

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components and functions.

- **Component Rendering**: Test that components render correctly
- **Component Props**: Test component behavior with different props
- **Utility Functions**: Test helper functions and utilities
- **State Management**: Test state updates and hooks

### UI Tests

UI tests ensure the user interface works as expected.

- **Page Rendering**: Test that pages load correctly
- **Navigation**: Test routing and navigation
- **User Interactions**: Test buttons, forms, and interactive elements
- **Responsive Design**: Test UI across different screen sizes

## Key Test Scenarios

### Core Functionality Tests

1. **Navigation**
   - All navigation links work correctly
   - Mobile menu opens and closes properly
   - Active page is highlighted in navigation

2. **Schedule Page**
   - Schedule loads correctly
   - Week expansion/collapse works
   - Match details display properly
   - Play Match and View Scorecard buttons navigate correctly

3. **Match Scoring**
   - Score entry works for all players
   - Score validation prevents invalid entries
   - Points calculation is accurate
   - Real-time updates work across devices

4. **Scorecard Summary**
   - Scorecard displays correctly for completed matches
   - All player scores are visible
   - Points allocation is accurate
   - PDF export works correctly

5. **Teams & Standings**
   - Teams display correctly
   - Standings are calculated accurately
   - Sorting and filtering work as expected

### MatchPoints Table and API Tests

1. **Table Persistence**
   - Verify the MatchPoints table exists in development database
   - Verify the MatchPoints table exists in production database
   - Confirm table structure matches expected schema (all required columns present)
   - Ensure table is not deleted during deployments

2. **API Functionality**
   - Test saving match points for a valid match
   - Test retrieving match points for a valid match
   - Verify error handling for invalid match IDs
   - Test batch updates of multiple hole points
   - Confirm total points are calculated correctly

3. **Deployment Verification**
   - Run ensure-match-points-table.js script to verify table exists
   - Test match-points API in preview deployment before promoting to production
   - Verify CORS handling for cross-origin requests
   - Confirm authentication is working correctly

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Verify ON DELETE CASCADE constraint works correctly when a match is deleted
   - Test unique constraints prevent duplicate entries for the same match and hole
   - Confirm default values are applied correctly for new records

### WebSocket Tests

- Connection establishes correctly in all environments
- Real-time updates are received and processed
- Connection gracefully handles disconnects and reconnects
- Fallback mechanisms work when WebSockets are unavailable

## Test Implementation

### Directory Structure

```
__tests__/
  ├── api/               # API tests
  ├── components/        # Component unit tests
  ├── pages/             # Page-level tests
  ├── e2e/               # End-to-end tests
  ├── utils/             # Utility function tests
  └── integration/       # Integration tests
```

### Test Utilities

- **Mock Data**: Consistent test data across all tests
- **Test Helpers**: Common utilities for testing
- **Custom Matchers**: Domain-specific assertions

## Continuous Integration

- Run tests on every pull request
- Run full test suite before deployment
- Track test coverage over time

## Test Environment

- Local development testing
- CI/CD pipeline testing
- Production verification tests
